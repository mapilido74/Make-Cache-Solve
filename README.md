Inverse matrix

This project consists in calculate the inverse of a matrix. We use two functions: makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve. The first function allow us to cache the inverse and return a "special matrix" like a list of values. The second function, first ask about if the inverse of the matrix exist in the cache. Is the answer is yes, then shown a message,  get it and return the inverse, if the answer is not, then calculate and return the inverse.
