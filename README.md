Inverse matrix

This project consists in calculate the inverse of a matrix. We use two functions: makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve. The first function allow us to cache the inverse and return a list of values. Teh second function, first ask about if the inverse of the matrix exist in the cache. Is the answer is yes, then get it and return the inverse, if the answer is not, then calculate the inverse.
